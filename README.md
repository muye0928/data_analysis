# some tasks for operations analysis based on registration data and bookings data

## 1. channel analysis
this task is to count how many customers came from each channel monthly and how many bookings came from each channel monthly.
It used some basic text data cleaning to deal with source classfication.

## 2. create heatmap based on zip codes
this tasks using zipcode from registration data
I used folium to create heatmap
I also used Tableau to create this heatmap which is more beautiful.

## 3.free services performance
this task is to measure the free services performance, to find how many people came back and completed bookings and how many people came back no matter their bookings status

## 4. track unique repeat bookings
this task is to track how many people come back(cumulative repeat bookings) after using different codes monthly
and how many people came back based on 2-month code-users and how many people came back based on this month code-users


## 5. count active customers monthly 
 we define active customers are those in registration tab and still subscribed and at least completed bookings once
